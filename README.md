3. **Error and Confirmation Messages**: Provides clear and concise feedback to the user.
4. **SQLite Database**: Stores information in a database for easier management.

## Requirements

- Required packages:
  - customtkinter
  - sqlalchemy

## Configurations
### Customizing Categories
The product categories displayed in the application can be customized. To modify the categories:

1. Open the `categories.json` file located in the root of the project.
2. Edit the list of categories to fit your needs.

**Example of `categories.json`:**
```json
{
  "categories": ["Electronics", "Furniture", "Groceries", "Books", "Clothing"]
}
``` 

## Validations and Messages

- **Name required**: The name input field is empty.
- **Product already exists**: The name already exists in the database.
- **Price required**: The price input field is empty.
- **Invalid price**: The price must be greater than 0.
- **Category required**: No category has been selected.
